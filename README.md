#Bertha

Bertha of Burgundy was the wife of Arduin of Ivrea who was an Italian king over a millennium ago. The Arduino
was named after Arduin.  So, what better name for a framework that exposes the inside of the Arduino to high-order
programming languages.  Sure, C is great and we can program the Arduino with it.  But Ruby is more powerful, Java
more ubiquitous, and C# more... uh... Microsofty.  But most importantly, the hardware that these languages run on
has more ready and sophisticated access to things like networking, video, and sound.  Things that the Arduino can
do if you buy more hardware but something like say... a Raspberry Pi can do just as easily.

##How To Use

There's not much that's been developed yet to actually use.  The sketch needs to be compiled and loaded on the
Arduino.  The various APIs that talk over the serial port to the Arduino will have specialize install instructions.

Right now, I am working on the Ruby library.  It will be a gem, of course.  I also have plans to add Java,
JavaScript/CoffeeScript for Node.js after that.  Then, whatever strikes my fancy!  Hopefully, some intrepid helper
(that's you!) will come along and support other platforms that I know less about.

Come back later when there's more too see or, better yet, get involved and send me some pull requests.
